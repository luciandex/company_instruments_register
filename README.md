# company_instruments_register

Company instruments register - a database with company instruments/objects.

What do I intend to create:
- use PHP OOP
- store the company intruments into a database
- add, edit, delete records from an user interface (minimal or template based)
- make lists and tables (format as PDF or XML based documents) with the records in a few clicks

- extra: make PDFs with signatures when is required.
