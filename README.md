# Company instruments register

Company instruments register - a database with company instruments/objects.

What do I intend to create:
- use PHP OOP
- store the company intruments into a database
- users access 
- add, edit, delete records from an user interface (minimal or template based)
- make lists, tables and instructions (format as HTML, PDF or XML) with the records in a few clicks

- extra: make PDFs with signatures when is required.
